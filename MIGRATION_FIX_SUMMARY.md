# Migration Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
The database migration script was failing with "There is no active transaction" error at line 267 during commit operation.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Transaction Auto-Commit**: MySQL automatically commits transactions when DDL statements (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE) are executed
2. **Mixed Transaction States**: The script was trying to commit after DDL operations that had already auto-committed
3. **Incomplete Migration Tracking**: Tables were created but not marked as completed in migration history

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Transaction Handling (`run_migration.php`)
- Removed unnecessary `PDO::ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT` manipulation
- Properly handled transactions around DDL operations
- Added transaction state checking before commit/rollback operations

### 2. Made Script Idempotent
- Added `migration_history` table to track completed migrations
- Each migration step checks if it was already completed
- Script can now be run multiple times safely without errors

### 3. Added Robust Error Handling
- Individual try-catch blocks for each migration step
- Proper rollback on errors
- Clear error reporting with step tracking

### 4. Created Helper Functions
- `tableExists()` - Check if a table exists
- `columnExists()` - Check if a column exists in a table
- `constraintExists()` - Check if a foreign key constraint exists
- `isMigrationCompleted()` - Check if a migration was already run
- `markMigrationCompleted()` - Mark a migration as complete

### 5. Fixed Migration History (`fix_migration_history.php`)
- Created a separate script to mark already-completed migrations
- Populated `user_tenant_access` table for existing admin users
- Ensured all migration steps are properly tracked

## Key Improvements

1. **DDL Operation Handling**
   - DDL operations (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE) now handled separately
   - No attempt to commit after auto-committed DDL statements

2. **Migration Tracking**
   - All migrations now tracked in `migration_history` table
   - Script detects already-completed steps and skips them

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Script can recover from partial completion
   - Failed steps are clearly reported
   - Can be re-run until all steps complete successfully

4. **Status Reporting**
   - Clear progress indicators for each step
   - Summary report shows completed vs failed steps
   - Migration history displayed at completion

## Files Modified
1. `/mnt/c/xampp/htdocs/CollaboraNexio/run_migration.php` - Main migration script (completely rewritten)
2. `/mnt/c/xampp/htdocs/CollaboraNexio/fix_migration_history.php` - Helper script to fix migration state

## Database Changes Confirmed
- ✅ Migration tracking table created
- ✅ User roles updated (user, manager, admin, super_admin)
- ✅ File approval columns added (status, approved_by, approved_at, rejection_reason)
- ✅ Multi-tenant access tables created
- ✅ Document approval system tables created
- ✅ Super admin user exists
- ✅ All migrations marked as completed

## How to Run
```bash
# Run the main migration script (safe to run multiple times)
php run_migration.php

# If needed, fix migration history
php fix_migration_history.php
```

## Migration Status
All 8 migration steps completed successfully:
1. ✅ update_user_roles_enum
2. ✅ add_approval_fields_to_files
3. ✅ create_user_tenant_access_table
4. ✅ create_document_approvals_table
5. ✅ create_approval_notifications_table
6. ✅ populate_user_tenant_access
7. ✅ create_super_admin_user
8. ✅ update_test_user_roles

The migration script is now fully functional and can handle:
- Fresh installations
- Partial completions
- Re-runs without errors
- Proper transaction management
- Clear status reporting
