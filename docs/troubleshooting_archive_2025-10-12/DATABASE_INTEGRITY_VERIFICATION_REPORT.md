## Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing document_editor_callbacks Table
**Status:** RESOLVED

**Problem:**
- The `document_editor_callbacks` table did not exist in the database
- OnlyOffice integration requires this table for tracking callback events from the document server

**Resolution:**
- Created table with full CollaboraNexio standard compliance:
  - `tenant_id` for multi-tenancy
  - `deleted_at` for soft delete
  - `created_at` / `updated_at` audit fields
  - Foreign keys to `tenants` and `document_editor_sessions`
  - 6 performance indexes including composite tenant indexes

**Migration:** `/database/fix_onlyoffice_critical_issues_v2.sql`

**Result:** Table created successfully with 0 records (ready for production use)

---

### Issue 2: Missing last_modified_by Column in files Table
**Status:** RESOLVED

**Problem:**
- The `files` table lacked the `last_modified_by` column
- OnlyOffice editor requires tracking which user last modified a file
- Missing foreign key relationship to `users` table

**Resolution:**
- Added `last_modified_by INT UNSIGNED NULL` column after `uploaded_by`
- Created foreign key constraint: `fk_files_last_modified_by` â†’ `users(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL
- Added performance index: `idx_files_last_modified_by (last_modified_by, updated_at)`
- Updated 9 existing files with `last_modified_by = uploaded_by` as initial value

**Migration:** `/database/fix_onlyoffice_critical_issues_v2.sql`

**Result:** Column added, 9 files updated successfully

---

### Issue 3: Missing deleted_at Column in document_editor_config
**Status:** RESOLVED

**Problem:**
- The `document_editor_config` table violated CollaboraNexio soft delete standards
- No `deleted_at` column for soft delete compliance
- Missing standard deleted_at index

**Resolution:**
- Added `deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT NULL` column
- Created composite index: `idx_config_tenant_deleted (tenant_id, deleted_at, created_at)`
- Ensures consistent soft delete pattern across all OnlyOffice tables

**Migration:** `/database/fix_onlyoffice_critical_issues_v2.sql`

**Result:** Soft delete compliance achieved

---

## Current Warnings (Non-Blocking)

### Warning 1: Backup Tables Without Custom Indexes
**Severity:** LOW
**Impact:** Minimal (backup tables only)

**Details:**
Two backup tables lack custom indexes:
1. `files_backup_20250927_134246`
2. `tenants_backup_locations_20251007`

**Recommendation:**
These are temporary backup tables and do not require indexing. Consider:
- Archiving old backups to reduce database size
- Dropping backup tables after verification period
- Moving backups to separate archive schema

**Action Required:** None (safe to ignore)

---

## Performance Recommendations

### High Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Archive Backup Tables**
   - Move `files_backup_20250927_134246` to separate schema
   - Move `tenants_backup_locations_20251007` to separate schema
   - Reduce main database size

2. **Add Full-Text Search Indexes**
   ```sql
   -- If file search by name is frequent:
   ALTER TABLE files ADD FULLTEXT INDEX idx_files_fulltext (name, description);

   -- If user search is frequent:
   ALTER TABLE users ADD FULLTEXT INDEX idx_users_fulltext (first_name, last_name, email);
   ```

3. **Partition Large Tables (Future)**
   - When `files` table exceeds 1M records, consider partitioning by `tenant_id`
   - When `audit_logs` exceeds 10M records, consider partitioning by date

### Medium Priority (Optional)

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Monitor slow query log for tables without optimal indexes
   - Use `EXPLAIN` on frequently run queries
   - Add covering indexes for common query patterns

2. **Session Cleanup Tuning**
   - Current cleanup event runs automatically
   - Consider adjusting cleanup interval based on usage patterns
   - Monitor session table growth rate

   - Verify editor configs per tenant

4. **Session Management Testing**
   - Test session creation on document open
   - Test session updates during editing
   - Test session closure on document close
   - Verify stale session cleanup (wait 24+ hours or manually trigger)

5. **Callback Testing** (if OnlyOffice callbacks are configured)
   - Verify callback events are recorded in `document_editor_callbacks`
   - Test force save callbacks
   - Test co-editing notifications
   - Verify error handling

### Known Limitations

**Non-Issues (Safe to Ignore):**
1. Two backup tables without indexes (by design)
