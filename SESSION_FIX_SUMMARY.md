# PHP Session Configuration Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application was showing PHP warnings on dashboard.php and other pages:
```
Warning: ini_set(): Session ini settings cannot be changed when a session is active
in C:\xampp\htdocs\CollaboraNexio\config.php on lines 64-67 and 69
```

## Root Cause
1. All PHP pages were calling `session_start()` on line 2, BEFORE including `config.php`
2. The `config.php` file was attempting to configure session settings with `ini_set()`
3. Once a session is started, PHP does not allow changing session configuration settings

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created centralized session initialization file
**File:** `/includes/session_init.php`
- Loads configuration constants from `config.php`
- Applies session settings BEFORE calling `session_start()`
- Checks if session is already started to avoid duplicate calls

### 2. Updated config.php
- Removed session configuration code (lines 62-69)
- Added comment indicating session config moved to `session_init.php`

### 3. Updated all PHP files
Replaced direct `session_start()` calls with:
```php
// Initialize session with proper configuration
require_once __DIR__ . '/includes/session_init.php';
```

### Files Updated:
- **Main pages:** dashboard.php, files.php, calendar.php, tasks.php, ticket.php,
  conformita.php, ai.php, aziende.php, utenti.php, profilo.php, audit_log.php,
  configurazioni.php, index.php, logout.php

- **API files:** api/auth.php, api/channels.php, api/chat-poll.php,
  api/chat_messages.php, api/dashboard.php, api/events.php, api/files.php,
  api/folders.php, api/messages.php, api/polling.php, api/tasks.php

- **Include files:** includes/auth_simple.php (updated session checks)

## Testing
Access `test_session_fix.php` to verify:
- Session initializes without warnings
- Session variables work correctly
- Session configuration is properly applied

## Result
The PHP session warnings have been eliminated. Session configuration is now properly
applied before the session starts, following PHP best practices.
