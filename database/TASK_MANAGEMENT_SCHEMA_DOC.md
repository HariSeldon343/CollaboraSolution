## Overview

The Task Management system provides a complete solution for tracking work items across the CollaboraNexio platform with:

- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Every task is scoped to a specific tenant
- **Soft delete compliance**: No hard deletes, all records use `deleted_at` timestamp
- **Hierarchical tasks**: Support for subtasks and checklists via self-referencing `parent_id`
- **Multi-user assignments**: N:N relationship between tasks and users
- **Complete audit trail**: Every change tracked in `task_history` table
- **Orphaned task detection**: Built-in views to identify tasks without valid assignees

### Key Features

- ✅ Kanban board support (status-based columns)
- ✅ Priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- ✅ Time tracking (estimated vs actual hours)
- ✅ Progress percentage (0-100%)
- ✅ Threaded comments with attachments
- ✅ Full-text search on titles and descriptions
- ✅ Project linking (optional)
- ✅ Tags and metadata (JSON)

## Indexes and Performance

### Multi-Tenant Query Optimization

**MANDATORY Pattern:** Every query MUST include both `tenant_id` and `deleted_at` filters:

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE tenant_id = ?
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
  AND status = 'todo';

-- ❌ WRONG - Security vulnerability!
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'todo';
```

### Index Strategy

1. **Composite Indexes:** All tables have `(tenant_id, deleted_at)` composite indexes for multi-tenant soft delete queries.

2. **Status Queries:** `idx_tasks_tenant_status` (tenant_id, status, deleted_at) enables efficient Kanban board queries.

3. **User-Centric Queries:** Separate indexes on `assigned_to` and `created_by` for "My Tasks" views.

4. **Full-Text Search:** FULLTEXT indexes on `tasks.title`, `tasks.description`, and `task_comments.content` for search functionality.

5. **Hierarchical Queries:** `idx_tasks_parent` (parent_id, order_index) for subtask ordering.

### Query Performance Tips

- **Use covering indexes:** Select only needed columns to leverage index-only scans
- **Avoid SELECT *:** Specify columns to reduce I/O
- **Use LIMIT:** For paginated results, always use LIMIT with appropriate OFFSET
- **Leverage views:** Pre-built views like `view_my_tasks` use optimized queries
- **Batch operations:** Use transactions for bulk inserts/updates

---

## Views and Helper Functions

### View: view_orphaned_tasks

**Purpose:** Identify tasks assigned to deleted or invalid users.

**Usage:**
```sql
-- Get all orphaned tasks for tenant
SELECT * FROM view_orphaned_tasks
WHERE tenant_id = 1;

-- Count orphaned tasks
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphan_count
FROM view_orphaned_tasks
WHERE tenant_id = 1;
```

**Columns:**
- `id`, `tenant_id`, `title`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`
- `assigned_to`, `created_by`, `created_at`
- `orphan_reason` - Why task is orphaned

**Orphan Reasons:**
- "No assignee" - `assigned_to` is NULL
- "Assigned user deleted" - User hard deleted (shouldn't happen)
- "Assigned user soft-deleted" - User has `deleted_at` set
- "Assigned user in different tenant" - Cross-tenant assignment (data integrity issue)

---

### View: view_task_summary_by_status

**Purpose:** Dashboard summary statistics grouped by status.

**Usage:**
```sql
-- Get summary for tenant
SELECT * FROM view_task_summary_by_status
WHERE tenant_id = 1;
```

**Columns:**
- `tenant_id` - Tenant ID
- `status` - Task status
- `task_count` - Total tasks in status
- `critical_count` - Critical priority count
- `high_count` - High priority count
- `overdue_count` - Overdue tasks in status

---

### View: view_my_tasks

**Purpose:** User-friendly view of tasks with computed fields.

**Usage:**
```sql
-- Get my tasks (requires application-level filtering by user_id)
SELECT * FROM view_my_tasks
WHERE tenant_id = 1
  AND (assigned_to = ? OR created_by = ?)
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY is_overdue DESC, due_date ASC;
```

**Computed Columns:**
- `is_overdue` - Boolean flag if past due date
- `days_until_due` - Days remaining (negative if overdue)
- `created_by_email` - Creator email address
- `created_by_name` - Creator full name

---

### Function: assign_task_to_user()

**Purpose:** Safely assign task to user with validation and audit logging.

**Signature:**
```sql
assign_task_to_user(
    p_task_id INT UNSIGNED,
    p_user_id INT UNSIGNED,
    p_assigned_by INT UNSIGNED
) RETURNS VARCHAR(255)
```

**Usage:**
```sql
-- Assign task 100 to user 5, assigned by user 1
SELECT assign_task_to_user(100, 5, 1) as result;
-- Returns: 'SUCCESS: Task assigned' or 'ERROR: ...'
```

**Validation:**
- Task exists and not soft-deleted
- User exists and not soft-deleted
- User belongs to same tenant as task
- Creates audit trail entry

**Side Effects:**
- Inserts into `task_assignments`
- Updates `tasks.assigned_to` if NULL
- Creates `task_history` entry

---

### Function: get_orphaned_tasks_count()

**Purpose:** Get count of orphaned tasks for a tenant.

**Signature:**
```sql
get_orphaned_tasks_count(p_tenant_id INT UNSIGNED) RETURNS INT
```

**Usage:**
```sql
-- Get orphan count for tenant 1
SELECT get_orphaned_tasks_count(1) as orphan_count;
```

**Use Case:** Dashboard warning badges, health checks, scheduled notifications.

## Orphaned Task Handling

### What is an Orphaned Task?

A task is considered "orphaned" when:
1. `assigned_to` is NULL (no assignee)
2. Assigned user has been soft-deleted (`users.deleted_at IS NOT NULL`)
3. Assigned user has been hard-deleted (shouldn't happen with RESTRICT constraint)
4. Assigned user belongs to different tenant (data integrity issue)

### Detection

**Automated Detection:** Use `view_orphaned_tasks` view:

```sql
-- Get all orphaned tasks
SELECT * FROM view_orphaned_tasks
WHERE tenant_id = 1;

-- Count orphans
SELECT get_orphaned_tasks_count(1) as count;
```

**Manual Detection:**
```sql
SELECT
    t.id,
    t.title,
    t.status,
    t.assigned_to,
    u.id as user_exists,
    u.deleted_at as user_deleted_at
FROM tasks t
LEFT JOIN users u ON t.assigned_to = u.id
WHERE t.tenant_id = ?
  AND t.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND t.status NOT IN ('done', 'cancelled')
  AND (
      t.assigned_to IS NULL
      OR u.id IS NULL
      OR u.deleted_at IS NOT NULL
  );
```

---

### Handling Orphaned Tasks

**Option 1: Reassign to Manager**
```sql
-- Reassign all orphaned tasks to default manager
UPDATE tasks t
SET assigned_to = ?, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE t.id IN (
    SELECT id FROM view_orphaned_tasks
    WHERE tenant_id = ?
);
```

**Option 2: Mark as Unassigned**
```sql
-- Set assigned_to to NULL for orphaned tasks
UPDATE tasks
SET assigned_to = NULL, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM view_orphaned_tasks
    WHERE tenant_id = ?
);
```

**Option 3: Notify and Warn**
```sql
-- Get orphans for notification email
SELECT
    t.id,
    t.title,
    t.priority,
    t.due_date,
    v.orphan_reason
FROM view_orphaned_tasks v
INNER JOIN tasks t ON v.id = t.id
WHERE v.tenant_id = ?
ORDER BY
    CASE t.priority
        WHEN 'critical' THEN 1
        WHEN 'high' THEN 2
        WHEN 'medium' THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END,
    t.due_date ASC;
```

### Prevention

**Use `task_assignments` table instead of `tasks.assigned_to`:**
- Multiple assignees provide redundancy
- When one user deleted, others remain
- Track assignment history

**Implement CASCADE appropriately:**
- `task_assignments.user_id` uses CASCADE so assignments auto-removed
- `tasks.created_by` uses RESTRICT to prevent creator deletion
- `tasks.assigned_to` uses SET NULL to preserve task

**Application-level checks:**
```php
// Before deleting user, check for assigned tasks
$orphanCount = $db->fetchOne(
    'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE assigned_to = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL',
    [$userId]
);

if ($orphanCount > 0) {
    // Reassign or warn before deletion
    throw new Exception("User has {$orphanCount} assigned tasks. Reassign before deletion.");
}
```

---

## Multi-Tenant Considerations

### MANDATORY Patterns

**Every Query Must Include:**
```sql
WHERE tenant_id = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

**Exception:** `super_admin` role can bypass tenant isolation:
```php
if ($currentUser['role'] !== 'super_admin') {
    $whereClauses[] = 'tenant_id = ?';
    $params[] = $currentUser['tenant_id'];
}
```

---

### Cross-Tenant Task Assignment

**FORBIDDEN:** Never assign task from tenant A to user from tenant B:

```sql
-- This should fail due to validation in assign_task_to_user() function
SELECT assign_task_to_user(100, 999, 1);
-- Returns: 'ERROR: User belongs to different tenant'
```

**Validation in Application:**
```php
// Verify user belongs to task's tenant
$taskTenantId = $db->fetchOne('SELECT tenant_id FROM tasks WHERE id = ?', [$taskId]);
$userTenantId = $db->fetchOne('SELECT tenant_id FROM users WHERE id = ?', [$userId]);

if ($taskTenantId !== $userTenantId) {
    throw new Exception('Cannot assign task to user from different tenant');
}
```

---

### Multi-Tenant Users

**Special Case:** Admin/super_admin users may have access to multiple tenants via `user_tenant_access` table.

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
-- Get tenants accessible by user
SELECT tenant_id
FROM user_tenant_access
WHERE user_id = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Get tasks from accessible tenants
SELECT t.*
FROM tasks t
WHERE t.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND t.tenant_id IN (
      SELECT tenant_id FROM user_tenant_access
      WHERE user_id = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL
  );
```

## Migration Guide

### Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Verify MySQL version >= 8.0
- [ ] Check free disk space (estimate: 10-20% of existing DB size)
- [ ] Review existing `tasks` table (if exists) for data migration needs
- [ ] Identify peak usage hours to schedule migration
- [ ] Notify users of maintenance window

---

### Migration Steps

**Step 1: Backup**
```bash
mysqldump -u root -p collaboranexio > backup_before_task_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

**Step 2: Run Migration**
```bash
mysql -u root -p collaboranexio < database/migrations/task_management_schema.sql
```

**Step 3: Verify**
```sql
-- Check tables created
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'task%';

-- Check record counts
SELECT 'tasks' as tbl, COUNT(*) FROM tasks
UNION ALL SELECT 'task_assignments', COUNT(*) FROM task_assignments
UNION ALL SELECT 'task_comments', COUNT(*) FROM task_comments
UNION ALL SELECT 'task_history', COUNT(*) FROM task_history;

-- Check views exist
SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE Table_type = 'VIEW';

-- Check functions exist
SELECT ROUTINE_NAME FROM information_schema.ROUTINES
WHERE ROUTINE_SCHEMA = 'collaboranexio'
  AND ROUTINE_NAME LIKE '%task%';
```

**Step 4: Test**
```sql
-- Test orphan detection
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM view_orphaned_tasks;

-- Test function
SELECT assign_task_to_user(1, 1, 1);
```

---

### Rollback Procedure

**If migration fails:**
```bash
# Restore from backup
mysql -u root -p collaboranexio < backup_before_task_migration_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql

# Or run rollback script
mysql -u root -p collaboranexio < database/migrations/task_management_schema_rollback.sql
```

---

### Post-Migration Tasks

- [ ] Update application code to use new schema
- [ ] Rebuild full-text search indexes if needed
- [ ] Run ANALYZE TABLE for query optimizer
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Train users on new task features
- [ ] Monitor performance for first 24-48 hours

---

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests

- [ ] **Create Task:** Insert new task with all required fields
- [ ] **Multi-Tenant Isolation:** Verify tenant A cannot see tenant B tasks
- [ ] **Soft Delete:** Delete task, verify `deleted_at` set, task hidden from queries
- [ ] **Hierarchical Tasks:** Create parent task, add subtasks, verify cascade delete
- [ ] **Multi-User Assignment:** Assign task to multiple users via `task_assignments`
- [ ] **Orphan Detection:** Delete assigned user, verify task appears in `view_orphaned_tasks`
- [ ] **Comments:** Add comment, reply to comment (threading), edit comment
- [ ] **Audit Trail:** Update task, verify `task_history` entry created
- [ ] **Full-Text Search:** Search tasks by title/description
- [ ] **Status Workflow:** Move task through statuses: todo → in_progress → review → done

---

### Performance Tests

- [ ] **Kanban Query:** Load 1000+ tasks, measure query time (target: < 100ms)
- [ ] **My Tasks Query:** Filter by assigned user, measure time (target: < 50ms)
- [ ] **Full-Text Search:** Search across 10K+ tasks (target: < 200ms)
- [ ] **Bulk Insert:** Insert 100 tasks in transaction (target: < 1s)
- [ ] **Index Usage:** Verify EXPLAIN shows index usage for common queries

---

### Security Tests

- [ ] **Tenant Isolation:** User from tenant A attempts to access tenant B task (should fail)
- [ ] **Soft Delete:** Verify deleted tasks not returned in queries
- [ ] **SQL Injection:** Test prepared statements with malicious input
- [ ] **Cross-Tenant Assignment:** Attempt to assign task to user from different tenant (should fail via function)

---

### Edge Cases

- [ ] **Orphan Tasks:** Delete assigned user, verify task handling
- [ ] **Circular References:** Attempt to set task as its own parent (should fail)
- [ ] **Invalid Progress:** Attempt to set progress > 100% (should fail via constraint)
- [ ] **Date Validation:** Set start_date > due_date (should fail via constraint)
- [ ] **Duplicate Assignment:** Assign same user twice to task (should fail via unique constraint)

---

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Query Optimization

1. **Use Indexes:** Always filter on indexed columns (tenant_id, status, assigned_to)
2. **Avoid SELECT *:** Select only needed columns
3. **Use LIMIT:** For paginated results
4. **Covering Indexes:** Query uses only indexed columns (no table access)
5. **Query Cache:** Enable for read-heavy workloads

---

### Table Optimization

```sql
-- Analyze tables for query optimizer
ANALYZE TABLE tasks, task_assignments, task_comments, task_history;

-- Optimize tables (defragment)
OPTIMIZE TABLE tasks, task_assignments, task_comments, task_history;

-- Rebuild indexes if fragmented
ALTER TABLE tasks ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

---

### Partitioning (For Large Datasets)

If `tasks` table exceeds 1M rows, consider partitioning by tenant_id or created_at:

```sql
-- Partition by tenant_id (range)
ALTER TABLE tasks
PARTITION BY RANGE (tenant_id) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (100),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (1000),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);

-- Or partition by date (for archival)
ALTER TABLE task_history
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(created_at)) (
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025),
    PARTITION p2025 VALUES LESS THAN (2026),
    PARTITION p_future VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

---

## Appendix: Example Data Flow

### Creating a Task with Assignments

**Step 1:** Create task
```sql
INSERT INTO tasks (tenant_id, title, description, status, priority, created_by, due_date)
VALUES (1, 'Build new feature', 'Implement user dashboard', 'todo', 'high', 10, '2025-11-01 23:59:59');

SET @task_id = LAST_INSERT_ID();
```

**Step 2:** Assign multiple users
```sql
-- Using function (recommended)
SELECT assign_task_to_user(@task_id, 11, 10);  -- Assign to user 11
SELECT assign_task_to_user(@task_id, 12, 10);  -- Assign to user 12

-- Or direct insert
INSERT INTO task_assignments (tenant_id, task_id, user_id, assigned_by, role)
VALUES
    (1, @task_id, 11, 10, 'owner'),
    (1, @task_id, 12, 10, 'contributor');
```

**Step 3:** Add comment
```sql
INSERT INTO task_comments (tenant_id, task_id, user_id, content)
VALUES (1, @task_id, 10, 'Please review the requirements document before starting');
```

**Step 4:** Update status
```sql
UPDATE tasks
SET status = 'in_progress', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = @task_id;

-- Audit trail auto-created by application trigger or manual insert
INSERT INTO task_history (tenant_id, task_id, user_id, action, field_name, old_value, new_value)
VALUES (1, @task_id, 11, 'status_changed', 'status', 'todo', 'in_progress');
```
