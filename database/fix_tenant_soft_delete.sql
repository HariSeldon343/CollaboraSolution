-- FIX: Tenant Soft Delete System
-- Version: 2025-10-12
-- Author: Database Architect
-- Description: Ensures tenants table has proper soft delete support
--              and fixes the get_tenant_list API filter issue

-- ============================================
-- CLEANUP INSTRUCTIONS
-- ============================================

/*
After running this migration:

1. UNCOMMENT line 85-88 to actually perform the soft delete
2. Restart Apache/PHP to clear any cached queries
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Test the tenant dropdown in files.php
5. Verify only "S.co (ID 11)" appears in the dropdown

If you need to HARD DELETE tenants instead:
    DELETE FROM tenants WHERE id != 11 AND id != 1;

If you need to RESTORE a deleted tenant:
    UPDATE tenants SET deleted_at = NULL WHERE id = <tenant_id>;

To view all deleted tenants:
    SELECT * FROM tenants WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
