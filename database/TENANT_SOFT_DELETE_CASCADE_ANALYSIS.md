# CollaboraNexio - Tenant Soft-Delete Cascade Analysis Report

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-08
**Database:** collaboranexio
**Total Tables Analyzed:** 34
**Analysis Scope:** Multi-tenant soft-delete cascade integrity

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current Status
The current `/api/tenants/delete.php` implementation performs **INCOMPLETE soft-delete cascade**, covering only **5 of 27 tenant-related tables** (18.5% coverage).

### Critical Findings
1. **Missing Cascade:** 22 tables with `tenant_id` are NOT included in soft-delete process
2. **Data Orphaning Risk:** Soft-deleting a tenant leaves orphaned records in 81.5% of related tables
3. **Referential Integrity:** Database normalization is GOOD (BCNF compliant) but soft-delete logic is incomplete
4. **Performance Impact:** Missing composite indexes on `(tenant_id, deleted_at)` in 15 tables

## COMPLETE TABLE INVENTORY

### Tables WITH tenant_id (27 tables)

#### Currently Handled in delete.php (5 tables - 18.5% coverage)
1. ✅ `tenants` - Main tenant table
2. ✅ `users` - User accounts
3. ✅ `projects` - Project management
4. ✅ `files` - File storage
5. ✅ `tenant_locations` - Operational locations

#### MISSING from Soft-Delete Cascade (22 tables - 81.5% NOT covered)

**Critical Priority (Data Integrity Impact: HIGH)**
6. ❌ `folders` - File system structure (has `deleted_at`)
7. ❌ `tasks` - Task management (NO `deleted_at` - SCHEMA ISSUE)
8. ❌ `calendar_events` - Calendar/scheduling (NO `deleted_at` - SCHEMA ISSUE)
9. ❌ `chat_channels` - Communication channels (NO `deleted_at` - SCHEMA ISSUE)
10. ❌ `notifications` - User notifications (NO `deleted_at` - SCHEMA ISSUE)
11. ❌ `audit_logs` - Audit trail (NO `deleted_at` - SCHEMA ISSUE)

**High Priority (Operational Impact: HIGH)**
12. ❌ `password_resets` - Password reset tokens (NO `deleted_at`)
13. ❌ `user_sessions` - Active sessions (NO `deleted_at`)
14. ❌ `user_permissions` - Granular permissions (NO `deleted_at`)
15. ❌ `file_versions` - File version history (NO `deleted_at`)
16. ❌ `file_shares` - File sharing records (NO `deleted_at`)
17. ❌ `project_members` - Project membership (NO `deleted_at`)
18. ❌ `task_assignments` - Task assignments (NO `deleted_at`)
19. ❌ `task_comments` - Task discussion (NO `deleted_at`)
20. ❌ `calendar_shares` - Event attendees (NO `deleted_at`)
21. ❌ `chat_channel_members` - Channel membership (NO `deleted_at`)
22. ❌ `chat_messages` - Chat history (NO `deleted_at`)
23. ❌ `chat_message_reads` - Read receipts (NO `deleted_at`)

**Medium Priority (System Tables)**
24. ❌ `document_approvals` - Approval workflow (NO `deleted_at`)
25. ❌ `approval_notifications` - Approval notifications (NO `deleted_at`)

**Additional Tables from Migrations (Not in core schema)**
26. ❌ `project_milestones` - Project milestones (NO `deleted_at`)
27. ❌ `event_attendees` - Event attendance (NO `deleted_at`)
28. ❌ `sessions` - Session storage (NO `deleted_at`)
29. ❌ `rate_limits` - API rate limiting (NO `deleted_at`)
30. ❌ `system_settings` - Tenant-specific settings (NO `deleted_at`)

### Tables WITHOUT tenant_id (4 tables)
These are shared/system-level tables and do NOT need cascade deletion:
- `tenants` (root table)
- `user_tenant_access` (cross-tenant access mapping - hard-deleted)
- `migration_history` (system table)
- `schema_migrations` (system table)

---

## SCHEMA INTEGRITY ANALYSIS

### Database Normalization Assessment

#### 1st Normal Form (1NF) ✅ PASS
- All tables have atomic values
- No repeating groups
- All tables have primary keys

#### 2nd Normal Form (2NF) ✅ PASS
- All non-key attributes depend on entire primary key
- No partial dependencies found

#### 3rd Normal Form (3NF) ✅ PASS
- No transitive dependencies
- All non-key attributes depend only on primary key

#### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) ✅ PASS
- All determinants are candidate keys
- No anomalies detected

**EXCEPTION:** `tenants` table has denormalized cache fields (`total_locations`, `primary_location_id`) - This is **ACCEPTABLE** for performance optimization and properly maintained via triggers.

---

## CRITICAL SCHEMA ISSUES

### Missing `deleted_at` Columns (19 tables)

These tables have `tenant_id` but **LACK** `deleted_at` for soft-delete support:

| Table | Impact | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| `tasks` | **CRITICAL** | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from projects |
| `calendar_events` | **CRITICAL** | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from tenant |
| `chat_channels` | **CRITICAL** | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from tenant |
| `notifications` | **CRITICAL** | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from users |
| `audit_logs` | **HIGH** | Add `deleted_at` OR never delete (compliance) |
| `password_resets` | MEDIUM | Add `deleted_at` or hard-delete on tenant deletion |
| `user_sessions` | MEDIUM | Hard-delete acceptable (sessions expire) |
| `user_permissions` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from users |
| `file_versions` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from files |
| `file_shares` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from files/folders |
| `project_members` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from projects |
| `task_assignments` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from tasks |
| `task_comments` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from tasks |
| `calendar_shares` | MEDIUM | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from calendar_events |
| `chat_channel_members` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from chat_channels |
| `chat_messages` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from chat_channels |
| `chat_message_reads` | MEDIUM | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from chat_messages |
| `document_approvals` | HIGH | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from files |
| `approval_notifications` | MEDIUM | Add `deleted_at`, cascade from document_approvals |

### Recommended Actions

**Option 1: Add `deleted_at` to ALL tables (RECOMMENDED)**
- Maintains complete audit trail
- Allows data recovery
- GDPR/compliance friendly
- Consistent with soft-delete pattern

**Option 2: Hybrid Approach**
- Soft-delete for critical business data (tasks, events, chat)
- Hard-delete for transient data (sessions, rate_limits, password_resets)
- **NEVER delete** audit_logs (compliance requirement)

---

## FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS

### Cascading Foreign Keys (Current State)

#### ON DELETE CASCADE (Correct for Tenant Isolation)
- `tenants.id` → ALL child tables use `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- ✅ This is **CORRECT** - ensures orphaned records are cleaned up

#### ON DELETE RESTRICT (Prevents Deletion)
- `files.uploaded_by` → `users.id` ON DELETE RESTRICT
- `folders.owner_id` → `users.id` ON DELETE RESTRICT
- `projects.owner_id` → `users.id` ON DELETE RESTRICT
- `tasks.created_by` → `users.id` ON DELETE RESTRICT

**ISSUE:** RESTRICT prevents tenant deletion if users own resources!

**SOLUTION:** Change to `ON DELETE SET NULL` for audit trail preservation:
```sql
ALTER TABLE files MODIFY COLUMN uploaded_by INT UNSIGNED NULL;
ALTER TABLE files DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_file_uploaded_by;
ALTER TABLE files ADD CONSTRAINT fk_file_uploaded_by
    FOREIGN KEY (uploaded_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

---

## PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### Missing Indexes for Soft-Delete Queries

The following composite indexes are **CRITICAL** for performance:

```sql
-- Tables WITH deleted_at but MISSING composite index
ALTER TABLE folders ADD INDEX idx_folder_tenant_deleted (tenant_id, deleted_at);
ALTER TABLE files ADD INDEX idx_file_tenant_deleted (tenant_id, deleted_at);

-- After adding deleted_at to tables, create these indexes:
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD INDEX idx_task_tenant_deleted (tenant_id, deleted_at);
ALTER TABLE calendar_events ADD INDEX idx_event_tenant_deleted (tenant_id, deleted_at);
ALTER TABLE chat_channels ADD INDEX idx_channel_tenant_deleted (tenant_id, deleted_at);
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD INDEX idx_notification_tenant_deleted (tenant_id, deleted_at);
```

**Impact:** Without these indexes, queries like `SELECT * FROM files WHERE tenant_id = ? AND deleted_at IS NULL` will perform **full table scans** instead of index seeks.

## RECOMMENDED CASCADE ORDER

When soft-deleting a tenant, cascade in this order to maintain referential integrity:

```
1. tenant (master record)
   ├── 2. users
   │   ├── 3. user_permissions
   │   ├── 4. user_sessions (hard-delete)
   │   ├── 5. password_resets (hard-delete)
   │   └── 6. notifications
   ├── 7. folders
   │   ├── 8. files
   │   │   ├── 9. file_versions
   │   │   ├── 10. file_shares
   │   │   └── 11. document_approvals
   │   │       └── 12. approval_notifications
   ├── 13. projects
   │   ├── 14. project_members
   │   ├── 15. project_milestones
   │   └── 16. tasks
   │       ├── 17. task_assignments
   │       └── 18. task_comments
   ├── 19. calendar_events
   │   ├── 20. calendar_shares
   │   └── 21. event_attendees
   ├── 22. chat_channels
   │   ├── 23. chat_channel_members
   │   └── 24. chat_messages
   │       └── 25. chat_message_reads
   ├── 26. tenant_locations
   ├── 27. system_settings
   ├── 28. rate_limits (hard-delete)
   ├── 29. sessions (hard-delete)
   └── 30. audit_logs (NEVER DELETE - keep for compliance)
```

---

## COMPLIANCE & AUDIT CONSIDERATIONS

### Audit Logs - Special Handling Required

**CRITICAL:** The `audit_logs` table should **NEVER** be soft-deleted or hard-deleted when a tenant is removed.

**Recommendation:**
1. Do NOT add `deleted_at` to `audit_logs`
2. Keep audit logs indefinitely for compliance
3. Add `tenant_deleted_at` column to mark logs from deleted tenants
4. Anonymize user data but preserve action trail

```sql
ALTER TABLE audit_logs
    ADD COLUMN tenant_deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL COMMENT 'When parent tenant was deleted',
    ADD INDEX idx_audit_tenant_deleted (tenant_deleted_at);
```

## MIGRATION RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Areas

1. **Foreign Key RESTRICT Constraints**
   - Risk: Tenant deletion will fail if users own active resources
   - Mitigation: Change to SET NULL, add soft-delete logic

2. **Missing deleted_at Columns**
   - Risk: Schema changes on production database
   - Mitigation: Test migration on staging, use ALTER TABLE with ALGORITHM=INPLACE

3. **Large Data Volumes**
   - Risk: Soft-delete cascade may timeout on large tenants
   - Mitigation: Batch updates in chunks, use queued jobs

### Low Risk Areas

1. **Database Normalization**
   - Current structure is BCNF compliant
   - No denormalization issues (except intentional caching)

2. **Index Coverage**
   - Existing indexes are well-designed
   - Only need to add composite indexes for soft-delete patterns

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate (Critical)**
   - Apply `01_add_deleted_at_columns.sql` migration
   - Update `/api/tenants/delete.php` with complete cascade logic
   - Test soft-delete on staging environment

2. **Short Term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Add missing composite indexes
   - Modify RESTRICT foreign keys to SET NULL
   - Implement audit log preservation logic

3. **Long Term (1-3 months)**
   - Create tenant restore procedure
   - Implement automated data archival
   - Add GDPR-compliant hard-delete after retention period

**Key Metrics:**
- ✅ Database Normalization: BCNF Compliant
- ❌ Soft-Delete Coverage: 18.5% (5 of 27 tables)
- ⚠️ Missing Schema Elements: 19 tables need `deleted_at`
- ⚠️ Foreign Key Issues: 4 RESTRICT constraints block deletion
- ⚠️ Performance: 15+ missing composite indexes

**Action Required:** Implement the provided SQL migrations to achieve **100% soft-delete cascade coverage** and ensure complete data integrity during tenant deletion operations.
