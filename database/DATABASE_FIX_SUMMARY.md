# Database Schema Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-09-25
## Fixed By: Database Architect

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Invalid Default Value for 'expires_at'
**Problem:** The `expires_at` field in `password_resets` and `user_sessions` tables had `TIMESTAMP NOT NULL` without a default value, which is incompatible with standard MySQL configurations.

**Solution:** Changed both occurrences to:
```sql
expires_at TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT NULL
```

### 2. Missing Demo Data
**Problem:** The schema lacked sample data for testing.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive demo data including:
- 2 sample tenants (Acme Corporation, Tech Innovations Inc)
- 5 sample users across both tenants
- 2 sample projects with team members
- 3 sample tasks
- Sample folders and files
- Sample chat channels and messages
- Sample calendar events and notifications

## Database Structure Verified

All 22 core tables successfully created:
1. `tenants` - Multi-tenancy support
2. `users` - User management with roles
3. `password_resets` - Password recovery
4. `user_sessions` - Session management
5. `user_permissions` - Fine-grained permissions
6. `projects` - Project management
7. `project_members` - Project team assignments
8. `tasks` - Task tracking
9. `task_assignments` - Multiple task assignees
10. `task_comments` - Task discussions
11. `folders` - File organization
12. `files` - Document storage
13. `file_versions` - Version control
14. `file_shares` - File sharing
15. `calendar_events` - Schedule management
16. `calendar_shares` - Event invitations
17. `chat_channels` - Communication channels
18. `chat_channel_members` - Channel membership
19. `chat_messages` - Message history
20. `chat_message_reads` - Read receipts
21. `notifications` - User notifications
22. `audit_logs` - Activity tracking

## Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Tenancy
- All tables include `tenant_id` for data isolation
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Row-level security ready

### Security & Audit
- Password hashing support
- Two-factor authentication fields
- Complete audit trail logging
- Session management with expiration

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic indexes on all foreign keys
- Composite indexes for multi-tenant queries
- Optimized data types (UNSIGNED integers, appropriate VARCHAR lengths)
- InnoDB engine for transaction support

## Testing Credentials

Default password for all demo users: `password` (bcrypt hashed)

### Tenant 1 (Acme Corporation)
- Admin: admin@acme.com
- Manager: jane.doe@acme.com
- User: bob.smith@acme.com

### Tenant 2 (Tech Innovations Inc)
- Admin: admin@tech.com
- User: dev@tech.com

## Next Steps

1. Configure application database connection
2. Implement authentication using the schema
3. Set up proper environment variables
4. Create database backup strategy
5. Plan for production migration

## Commands to Reinitialize

If you need to recreate the database:
```bash
/mnt/c/xampp/mysql/bin/mysql.exe -u root < database/03_complete_schema.sql
```

## Schema File Location
`/mnt/c/xampp/htdocs/CollaboraNexio/database/03_complete_schema.sql`
