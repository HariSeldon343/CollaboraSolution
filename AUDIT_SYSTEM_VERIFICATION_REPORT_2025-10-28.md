|--------|-------|--------|
| Query time (20 rows) | 0.33ms | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| Target | <100ms | ✅ MET |
| Performance rating | EXCELLENT | - |

**Scalability Projection:**
- Current: 12 logs, 0.33ms

- At 100,000 logs: ~20-50ms (indexed + partitioning recommended)

**Key Findings:**
- Query performance exceptional (0.33ms)
- Well below 100ms target
- Composite indexes optimized for multi-tenant queries

---

## Table Health

**✅ PASS** - No corruption detected

| Table | Health Check | Status |

## Testing Recommendations

**✅ Database Verified** - No action required

**User Browser Testing:**
1. Clear browser cache (CTRL+F5)
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:8888/CollaboraNexio/audit_log.php
3. Verify statistics cards load real data (not placeholders)
4. Verify table shows real audit logs (not "Nessun log trovato")
5. Click "Dettagli" on any log → verify modal opens with JSON formatting
6. (super_admin only) Click "Elimina Log" → verify 200 OK (not 500 error)

**Integration Testing:**
1. Login → verify audit log created with action='login'
2. Navigate dashboard → verify audit log with action='access', entity_type='page'
3. Upload file → verify audit log with action='create', entity_type='file'
4. Delete file → verify audit log with action='delete', entity_type='file'
5. Update user → verify audit log with action='update', entity_type='user'
