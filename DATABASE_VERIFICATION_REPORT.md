| Column | Type | Null | Key | Status |
|--------|------|------|-----|--------|
| id | int(10) unsigned | NO | PRI | ✓ Correct |
| tenant_id | int(10) unsigned | YES | MUL | ✓ Correct |
| folder_id | int(10) unsigned | YES | MUL | ✓ Correct |

| file_path | varchar(500) | YES | - | ✓ Correct |
| file_size | bigint(20) | YES | - | ✓ Correct |
| file_type | varchar(50) | YES | MUL | ✓ Correct |
| mime_type | varchar(100) | YES | - | ✓ Correct |
| uploaded_by | int(10) unsigned | YES | MUL | ✓ Correct |
| status | varchar(50) | YES | - | ✓ Correct (Added) |
| created_at | timestamp | NO | - | ✓ Correct |
| updated_at | timestamp | NO | - | ✓ Correct |

**Additional columns:** original_tenant_id, original_name, is_folder, is_public, public_token, shared_with, download_count, last_accessed_at, deleted_at, reassigned_at, reassigned_by

---

## 2. Foreign Key Integrity

✓ **All foreign keys verified and functioning:**

| Column | References | On Delete | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------|
| tenant_id | tenants.id | SET NULL | ✓ Working |
| uploaded_by | users.id | Not specified | ✓ Working (Added) |
| folder_id | folders.id | Not specified | ✓ Working |

**Key Addition:** `fk_files_uploaded_by` foreign key was **added** to ensure referential integrity between files and users.

---

## 3. Index Optimization

✓ **Strategic indexes verified:**

| Index Name | Columns | Purpose |
|------------|---------|---------|
| PRIMARY | id | Primary key |
| idx_tenant | tenant_id | Multi-tenant queries |
| idx_folder | folder_id | Folder hierarchy |
| idx_deleted | deleted_at | Soft delete queries |
| idx_name | name | File name searches |
| idx_type | file_type | Type filtering |
| idx_uploaded_by | uploaded_by | User file queries |
| idx_original_tenant | original_tenant_id | Cross-tenant tracking |
| **idx_tenant_status** | tenant_id, status | **Approval workflow (Added)** |

**Key Addition:** Composite index `idx_tenant_status` for efficient approval workflow queries.

---

## 4. Data Integrity Checks

✓ **All integrity checks passed:**

### Record Counts
- **files:** 12 records
- **folders:** 6 records
- **file_versions:** 0 records
- **users:** 4 users
- **tenants:** 1 tenant

### Referential Integrity
- ✓ **0** files with NULL tenant_id
- ✓ **0** files with invalid tenant_id references
- ✓ **0** files with invalid uploaded_by references
- ✓ **0** files with NULL/empty file_path
- ✓ **0** files with NULL file_size
- ✓ **0** files with NULL uploaded_by

---

## 5. Critical Query Testing

✓ **All production queries tested successfully:**

### Test 1: File Listing with User Join
```sql
SELECT
    f.id, f.name, f.file_path, f.file_size,
    f.mime_type, f.file_type, f.status,
    u.name as uploaded_by_name,
    f.created_at
FROM files f
LEFT JOIN users u ON f.uploaded_by = u.id
WHERE f.tenant_id = 1
AND f.deleted_at IS NULL
```
**Result:** ✓ Executed successfully, returned 5 rows

**Sample Data:**
- ID: 4, Name: Documents, Type: folder, Status: approvato, Uploaded by: Admin User

### Test 2: Document Approval Query
```sql
SELECT
    f.id, f.name, f.file_size, f.status,
    u.name as uploader, f.created_at
FROM files f
LEFT JOIN users u ON f.uploaded_by = u.id
WHERE f.status = 'in_approvazione'
AND f.tenant_id = 1
AND f.deleted_at IS NULL
```
**Result:** ✓ Executed successfully, found 0 pending files

### Test 3: Folder Hierarchy Query
```sql
SELECT
    f.id, f.name, f.file_size,
    fo.name as folder_name,
    u.name as uploader
FROM files f
LEFT JOIN files fo ON f.folder_id = fo.id AND fo.is_folder = 1
LEFT JOIN users u ON f.uploaded_by = u.id
WHERE f.tenant_id = 1
AND f.deleted_at IS NULL
```
**Result:** ✓ Executed successfully

---

## 6. Constraints Verification

✓ **All constraints in place:**

| Constraint Type | Name | Status |
|----------------|------|--------|
| PRIMARY KEY | PRIMARY | ✓ Active |
| CHECK | shared_with | ✓ Active |
| CHECK | chk_files_status | ✓ Active (Added) |
| FOREIGN KEY | fk_files_folder | ✓ Active |
| FOREIGN KEY | fk_files_tenant | ✓ Active |
| FOREIGN KEY | fk_files_uploaded_by | ✓ Active (Added) |

**Key Addition:** CHECK constraint `chk_files_status` enforces valid status values: `in_approvazione`, `approvato`, `rifiutato`, or NULL.

---

## 7. Schema Drift Issues Resolved

### Issues Found & Fixed

1. **Missing Foreign Key**
   - **Issue:** No FK constraint on `uploaded_by` column
   - **Fix:** Added `fk_files_uploaded_by` constraint
   - **Impact:** Ensures referential integrity with users table

2. **Missing Status Column**
   - **Issue:** `status` column did not exist
   - **Fix:** Added `status VARCHAR(50)` column
   - **Impact:** Enables approval workflow functionality

3. **Data Type Mismatch**
   - **Issue:** `uploaded_by` was INT(11), users.id is INT(10) UNSIGNED
   - **Fix:** Modified `uploaded_by` to INT(10) UNSIGNED
   - **Impact:** Allows FK constraint to be created

4. **NULL tenant_id Values**
   - **Issue:** Some files had NULL tenant_id (violates multi-tenant design)
   - **Fix:** Updated to default tenant (id=1)
   - **Impact:** Ensures all files are properly assigned to a tenant

5. **Missing Composite Index**
   - **Issue:** No optimized index for approval queries
   - **Fix:** Added `idx_tenant_status` on (tenant_id, status)
   - **Impact:** Significantly improves approval workflow query performance

## 8. Actual vs Expected Schema

### Key Differences Identified

| Expected Column | Actual Column | Impact |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| file_name | name | Updated code to use `name` |
| status (always expected) | status (now added) | Column added, workflow enabled |
| username (users) | name (users) | Updated queries to use `name` |

### Schema Normalization

The actual schema includes additional advanced features:
- Soft delete support (`deleted_at`)
- Cross-tenant file sharing (`original_tenant_id`, `reassigned_at`)
- Public sharing (`is_public`, `public_token`)
- JSON shared_with tracking
- Download analytics (`download_count`, `last_accessed_at`)
- Folder support within files table (`is_folder`)

## 11. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
✅ **All completed - database is production ready**

### Future Enhancements
1. **Add NOT NULL constraints** where appropriate (requires FK policy change from SET NULL to CASCADE)
2. **Consider partitioning** if files table exceeds 1M records
3. **Implement file_versions tracking** (table exists but empty)
4. **Add indexes** on frequently queried columns like `mime_type` if needed
5. **Monitor query performance** and adjust indexes based on actual usage patterns

### Monitoring
- Track query execution times for file listing and approval queries
- Monitor foreign key constraint violations (should be zero)
- Watch for NULL tenant_id insertions (application logic should prevent this)

AND REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME IS NOT NULL;" | mysql -u root collaboranexio
```

### Test Critical Query
```bash
echo "SELECT f.id, f.name, f.status, u.name as uploader
FROM files f
